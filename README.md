## Objective
 
Analyze a phishing email and investigate a Windows-based compromise that involves powershell commands and data exfiltration, utilizing provided artefacts and tools.

### Skills Learned

- Email Analysis
  - Extracting metadata and attachments from .eml files.
  - Decoding and reconstructing encoded attachments using CLI and GUI tools.
- Endpoint Security Investigation
  - Parsing and analyzing Powershell logs to identify malicious commands.
  - Filtering relevant data from JSON logs using jq and other CLI tools.
- Network Traffic Analysis
  - Investigating packet captures using Wireshark.
  - Identifying malicious domains, ip address, and data exfiltration techniques.
- Threat Actor Profiling
  - Correlating findings with known TTPs of threat groups.
  - Assessing the impact of an attack on organizational security.

### Tools Used

- lnkparse: A Python tool used to parse Windows shortcut (.lnk) files, revealing the embedded commands and payload paths.
- Wireshark: A GUI-based network protocol analyzer for inspecting packet capture files and identifying malicious network activity.
- jq: A command-line JSON processor for filtering and parsing large JSON files, such as PowerShell logs, to focus on specific entries or commands.
- Thunderbird: An open-source email client used to open and analyze the contents of the phishing email (dump.eml), including attachments.
- Command-Line Tools (grep, base64): These tools will assist in manually decoding and processing email data, including extracting base64-encoded payloads.

## Outcome

- Phishing Analysis: Dissect and analyze phishing emails, understand how malicious attachments are hidden, and successfully extract embedded payloads.
- Endpoint Investigation: Investigate Powershell logs (in JSON format) to understand the attackerâ€™s methods, identify executed commands, and uncover their impacts on the compromised system.
- Network Traffic Forensics: Analyze packet captures to track the exfiltration process, including identifying the tools and techniques used by the attacker to send sensitive data out of the network.
- Data Exfiltration Detection: By correlating Powershell logs with network traffic, understand how the attacker exfiltrated data, how it was encoded, and how to reconstruct the stolen data using network traffic.
- Incident Response: By completing the analysis from email attachment extraction through to network traffic examination, uderstand how to conduct a full incident investigation, from initial compromise to data exfiltration, equip to respond to similar real-world incidents.
